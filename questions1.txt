1. When you first log in, what is the absolute path of your home directory?

    <<< YOUR ANSWER BELOW HERE (and do not remove this line)
    /home/stu9/s16/kjb2503

2. What command will display the contents of your current
working directory, so that it shows the difference between
files and directories? SHOW THE FULL COMMAND.

    <<< YOUR ANSWER BELOW HERE (and do not remove this line)
    ls -l

3. What command would you use to change your working directory from
your home directory to the existing subdirectory named Courses?
SHOW THE FULL COMMAND.

    <<< YOUR ANSWER BELOW HERE (and do not remove this line)
    cd Courses

4. Within the Courses/ subdirectory, what command would you use to
create the subdirectory named csci243 and SHOW THE FULL COMMAND.

    <<< YOUR ANSWER BELOW HERE (and do not remove this line)
    mkdir csci243

5. When warning.c is compiled as: 
        gcc -c warning.c
    There is no indication of any warnings/problems.
    
    a.) What compiler flag is used to enable the display of warnings?
    
        <<< YOUR ANSWER BELOW HERE (and do not remove this line)
        -Wall (but if you want all the warnings you can use -Wextra in addition to -Wall)
    
    b.) In your own words, explain all warnings from compiling warning.c.
    
        <<< YOUR ANSWER BELOW HERE (and do not remove this line)
        The first warning is -Wunused-variable which is basically saying that while attempting
        compile the program, gcc found a variable which is set but never used. (mostly just a
        memory alert).
        The next one is -Wmain which is saying that when creating a 'main' function, it can 
        either have 2 parameters, or 0 parameters. In this case it found 1 and thus generated
        a -Wmain warning.
        Next is another -Wunused-variable (for variable 'x' within main) which is again set but
        never used.
        Then we get another unused variable warning for argc in the main function.
        Lastly we get to -Wreturn-type which is saying that in a function which states it has
        a non-void return value (a.k.a. somewhere a 'return' statement should be found), there
        is no return. Thus when the function completes but no return statement was found, the
        -Wreturn-type warning is created.
    
    c.) Fix warning.c so it compiles without warning and runs correctly.

	(Your answer is the submitted code.)

6. What compiler flag compiles C programs using the ISO C99 standard?

    <<< YOUR ANSWER BELOW HERE (and do not remove this line)
    -std=c99
   
7. Put the four steps of compilation process into their proper order from
first to last.

    A. Link
    B. Assemble
    C. Preprocess
    D. Compile
    
    <<< YOUR ANSWER BELOW HERE (and do not remove this line)
    Preprocess, Compile, Assemble, Link. [Which is: C, D, B, A]

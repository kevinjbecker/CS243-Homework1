8. Given the program files main.c, circle.h and circle.c:

    a.) What commands will compile the source files into object files?
        Show the FULL command.
        
        <<< YOUR ANSWER BELOW HERE (and do not remove this line)
        gcc -std=c99 -Wall -Wextra -pedantic -c main.c circle.c
        
    b.) What command will link the object files into an executable named broken?
        Show the FULL command.
        
        <<< YOUR ANSWER BELOW HERE (and do not remove this line)
        gcc -std=c99 -o broken main.o circle.o
        
    c.) Why does the program compile but fail to link?
    
        <<< YOUR ANSWER BELOW HERE (and do not remove this line)
        The circle.h file contains a declaration for the function "getArea(int);".
        This means that any program which includes the header circle.h is promised
        a getArea(int) function somwhere, as such it can compile. That being said, 
        when trying to link circle.c and main.c, there is no implementation for 
        the function and linking fails. The solution was to change the function 
        "getAreas(int)" in circle.c to "getArea(int)" (removing the "s").
